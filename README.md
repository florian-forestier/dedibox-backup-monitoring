# Dedibox backup monitoring

A simple tool who reads API from Online.net and parse them into a Prometheus-compatible format.

# Build

## Docker

`docker build -t="dedibackup_poller:latest" .`

## Golang

`go build -o dedibackup_poller github.com/Artheriom/dedibox-backup-monitoring/cmd`

# Run

* You should provide an Online.net API Token
    * You can get yours on https://console.online.net/fr/api/access (NEVER SHARE THIS TOKEN !)
    * Ways to provide token:
        * Through `-token` command-line argument
        * Through `DEDIBOX_API_TOKEN` environment variable (recommended)


* Program will bind on port 9101 (as 9100 is usually used by Prometheus node exporter)
    * You can change this behaviour through `-port` command-line argument
* Metrics will be available under `/metrics` path.

* Docker example command: `docker run -d -p 9101:9101 -e DEDIBOX_API_TOKEN=61v4vii9f1q817izy5efnc9mtqo6ui2p8teg20ib dedibackup_poller:latest`
* CLI example command: `./dedibackup_poller token=61v4vii9f1q817izy5efnc9mtqo6ui2p8teg20ib`
